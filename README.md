Hello,  
I'll skip any introduction about my self because it is the same sad story you have listened already, so I'll go straight to the point.

This post is the index of a series of arguments I'll write, reflect and clarify, also to myself, about the ethereum blockchain technologies.  
We will see the developer tools you will need to write, deploy your smart contracts, design the front-end connected to them, and many other things we'll discover during the journey.

Anytime I'll add a new argument to the eth_series, you will be able to access it because it will be linked here, and it will be possible for you also to see the complete source code on GitHub, yes also the source code of this one.

You, reader so affectionate, remember that technologies go very fast so maybe the content of this eth_series it is already obsolete. So don't kick my butt if something goes wrong with your learning and just email me I'll do my best to see if it is fixable or not __oooooor__ why not to collaborate to the open source project on GitHub? Everyone welcome.

Before asking read, please, what this blog **IS** and what **is NOT**:  
* **is NOT** a subliminal advertising blog, any proprietary not open source project will not be mentioned or referenced in pictures or videos. If you wish to be advertised please contact me, and we will talk about. Every advertisement to **non** open source project will be **CLEARLY** exposed.
* **IS** a personal opinion about how to shoot the prefigured target. Everyone achieves their goals in different ways.
* **is NOT** a **MUST**
* **IS** a way for me to earn **ETH** and I mean it, no money just cryptos. by default you can donate me ETH but if you wish to donate other cryptos please be in touch, I will evaluate the project behind the token you wish to donate, and I'll back to you, maybe...
* **IS** my personal path in learning ethereum blockchain.
* **is NOT** a challenge.
* **is NOT** going to answer where the name "_xioxium_" come from, I'll not do it either under torture. I swear, on your gods guys!
* **is NOT** a manifesto on how great I'm in developing, because I started very few months ago to dive into ethereum blockchain development.
* **IS** meant to create connections and eventually a community.
* **IS** a good starting point for beginners cause the more I advance the more information you get.
* **is NOT** the blog of a professor. I don't say you will learn, but I say you will see, because I show not teach.
* **IS** going to update this list frequently.

*Said so, check ðŸ‘‡ for the shows*
